this will e the first commit
The basic idea behind the project will be managing a person's life completely by themselves.
This will cover basic areas mainly health management , time management, wealth management  and ultimately life management. 

By this we can store privately each and every details of our lives on our local mobiles without sending data on server thus complete security this point is not yet finalized just an idea.

Main idea is storing each and every details of our daily routine. 
For example at 6 o clock you wake up then 6.30 to 7 exercise. then 7 to 7.30 2 egg sandwich breakfast,
once you enter this data , app will convert this data to management and day-tracking like 
30 mins given to health under exercise(we can manage type of exercise also), 
30 mins again given to health where approx. 400Kcal is gained from 2 egg sandwiches
In this manner you can add your complete day routine.
You can also set any day routine as your perfect/ideal day, so that app will compare the details from this day to you current day and notify you that you did great by doing 40 mins of exercise i.e 10 mins more from your ideal day or you should buck-up as you ate only 1 egg sandwich i.e you gained only 200KCal of energy during breakfast let's cover  that up in lunch.
This is a simple example where you can maintain and manage each and every minute details of your health on regular and a daily basis. As we all know small success steps will bring great results.

similarly we can manage time and wealth too.
